			<p>After creating the tentative flow of the team’s story using the text format of a script, as well as beginning to draw preliminary sketches of our characters and environment, we have now moved into the phase of storyboarding.</p>

			<p>However, prior to continue moving forward, the team discussed various components that requires revision which were deceiving and not quite flushed out in the previous milestone.  Furthermore, we had to think about how to unfold the story with the constraint of no narrator, which will be necessary to integrate compelling visuals that can drive the story forward.</p>

			<p>Hence, this week, the team held a meeting to brainstorm various shots required in our short animation that can translate the idea of Otis getting laid off at a oil factory in the 2D world (which is considered as a beer factor, but because robots don’t drink beer, but need oil to function properly, the team decided to make this allusion using beer) to finding a new job as a wine connoisseur in the 3D world.  With the transition of a gloomy 2D world to a bright and happy 3D world, the team wanted to recreate the idea of evolution in technology as well.</p>

			<p>Below, you will see visuals of ideas of each frame that were sketched out to make the story that can be animated in a cohesive manner starting from the opening scene to the ending scene.</p>
