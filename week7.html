			<p>After obtaining feedback from our instructors, we realized that the scope of the our animation project might be challenging to complete within the amount of time remaining and skill constraints. As a result, we have revised our storyboard some more by cutting down detailed components and to condense the story.</p>

			<p>Originally, our main character, who once lived in the 2D world suffered from a miserable lifestyle such that life was boring and that he can only move in two-dimensional space in addition to getting laid off at work which he then goes into a bar to try to drink his sorrow away. Following that, miraculously, he gets thrown out to the 3D world which the turn around was that he manages to find the world a lot more interesting, feels more happy and eventually gets a job of his dream as a wine connoisseur.</p>

			<p>Due to too much micro-narratives in detail, there were misinterpretation of how Otis, our protagonist gets from the 2D to 3D world such that it is the possibility of the oil Otis drinking at first. Furthermore, because there were too many elements happening all at once, the contrast were minimal to effectively tell a concise story.</p>

			<p>For the new version as seen below, we have alluded the story of Alice in Wonderland. Since Otis can only maneuver himself around in 2D space of the miserable 2D world, he could not see the danger signs which he then accidentally falls into a hole. Afterwards, the hole lead Otis into a 3D world where the protagonist became excited by exploring himself and the new space where he finally has a happy life.</p>
