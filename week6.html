			<p>With the extension of our storyboard and pitch deadline, the team decided to ask for feedback in order to elaborate, as well as develop a much more compelling story that flows cohesively.</p>

			<p>Therefore, the animatic and storyboard below demonstrates a revised version from the previous week since the team notices that too much of the 2D world has been focused as well and so we decided to make adjustments by taking out some of the non important elements in the 2D world and many more.  For instance, more camera angles has been integrated to show various perspectives as compared to last week, most of them were either long shots or medium shots.  Furthermore, some scenes and shots were taken out while some new ones have been implemented to better flush out the story.</p>

			<p>As a result, with this revised version, it aims to explain more contrast of the difference between the 2D world and the 3D world that Otis, our protagonist goes through.  For example, from a gloomy world into a happy world, from a 2D world of low degrees of freedom to a 3D world of multiple degrees of freedom and to portray more featured experience that Otis gets in the new world, as well as from Otis getting laid off from a job to finding a new job.</p>

			<p>In the clip below, it shows the animatic of our storyboard along with the pitch.</p>
