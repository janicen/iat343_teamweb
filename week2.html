			<p>After one week of ideating, the team came back together and met again to see potential directions that we can go with.  With further discussion and our level of skills in 3D animation, we decided to pursuit with an idea of a story starting from the 2D world and then into the 3D world.  Also, based on the course readings of history in animation and colour, we were hoping to map the concept in the evolution of television technology into an animation such as from the old black and white TVs to colour TVs.</p>
			<p>With the idea in mind, the team wondered what type of environment and fictional character can be used.  Then we came up with a robot who works at a factory and to add a bit of humor, the robot has oil drinking problem as well.  The reason for this character is that we see that animals are used quite often and humans will be hard to model, as well as to rig, so we decided that it will be different to see how a robot behaves in a 2-dimensional world and into the 3-dimensional world.  Furthermore, because of our concept in mapping the evolution of television technology, we thought that a robot would represent better.  At last, the team started to split the roles to begin visual ideation.</p>
			<p>Aries = Environment design
				<br>Yuki = Character design
				<br>Janice = Story writer
				<br>Grace = Character design
				<br>Zach = Environment design
			</p>
			<p>Janice first completed a draft of the story in order for the team to visualize elements that are required to be integrated in the animation.  As seen in the link below, it will bring you to the script created.</p>
			<p>Script link = <a href="./doc/script1.pdf">script 1</a></p>
			<p>Meanwhile, Yuki and Grace began coming up with sketches of a potential main character that can be easily empathized by the audience.  As seen in the visuals below, they are original ideas of the animation main character and environmental characters.</p>

			<p>In order to have an immersive environment that the audience can delve into, Aries and Zach were in charge of creating the 2D visuals as seen in the sketch below which will then be used as backgrounds in the animation film.</p>
