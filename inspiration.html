			<p>The context of our animation involves being in the category of Science, under the style of a pure animation short film which brings the fun of Comedy.  With a comedic short animation, the team aims to target the audience of children using a ludic style to tell a story of a robot’s life going from the 2D world into the 3D world.</p>
			<p>Prior to starting the animation project development, the team began looking at various short animation films in order to draw inspirations and to become aware of the large range of possibilities.</p>
			<p>For instance we were intrigued by this animation call 99, as seen in the visuals below, how the piece resembles to a work of painting, but the main characters were rendered in three-dimension.  Furthermore, there was a deep and meaningful story about life, which the complex idea is told through the work of art and through imagery.</p>

			<p>Eventually, after doing course readings about the history of colour theory in computer systems and the history of animation, we were interested in translating the concept of technological history into an animation short.  Furthermore, we also came across an  animation short call Flatland, as seen below which seemed to be relevant to our idea such as going from the 2D world to the 3D world.</p>

			<p>As for the background, our inspiration came from the game Machinarium as seen below, which uses a very minimalist style with the addition of three-dimensional drawn artifacts and that it suited the story that we’re trying to tell.  Furthermore, we were captivated by the theme of steam punk, which also relates to our robot character, so we decided to move forward with this idea.</p>

			<p>Due to the team’s low competency in 3D animation, the various brainstormed ideas and animations seen allows us to use the design method of smart recombination to draw from various sources under the constraints of the team’s skill level capabilities.</p>
